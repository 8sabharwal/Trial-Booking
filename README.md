# Trial-Booking
Course booking for a educational site
I build this project for a online educational company for trial slot booking in 
this project I used API calls to fetch the dynamic data and display into form 
and user will fill the details then on submission of form an email is received by the user.
For the frontend Html ,css,and bootstrap are used and for backend Nodejs and express are
used and Nodemailor is used for sending mails after successful booking of slots.
